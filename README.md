# gif-generator
JPGs --> GIF

## Installation
`pip install pillow moviepy`

## Usage
Put identically sized JPGs, named in order you would like the frames to be, in the input folder. Run `python main.py`, view your new gif at `result.gif` in the same folder.
The script will use the `output` folder as scratch space for the frames of the GIF, which will be deleted after the GIF is generated.
